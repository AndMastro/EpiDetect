here interactions are properly found. Where is the bias towards high margnal effets?
Here the fact is that snps with marginal effects are also the ones iteracting, the other snps not not have
any marginal effect on the trait. If we inspect the ME results, we see that those two SNPs have high
marginal effects, that biases the output.
So we only see the interacting pair sincee the marginal of the snp pair with a hgih ranked one is null (so in the
regression formula this contributios is alsost nullified).
so it cannot be seen as an interacton, oppositely of what happens with real BP data, in which
two snps with a consistent marginal effect are sometimes misclassified as two interacting snps, which is 
not said to be true.
Moreover,, we are in a case/cntrole set, for which boost was designed. BP is a regression problem, and
we are froce to make an appoximation when using BOOST. epiCID is for both regression and classification problems.

TO SUM UP:
Marginal effects in BOOST bias the results: two SNPs with high marginal effect are seen as interacting (not always true)
